This page is an index of the repositories and documentation pages for research projects and code libraries hosted at the LOCIE laboratory (Universit√© Savoie Mont-Blanc). We also have a [website](http://www.polytech.univ-smb.fr/index.php?id=2884&L=0) for more generic information about our research topics and ongoing work.

# [](#comis)COMIS

[The COMIS project](https://wthomare.github.io/comis/) aims at developing a new method for evaluating the efficiency of innovative systems in energy-efficient buildings, through an original commissioning approach focused on the first year of a building's operation, which is often particularly critical in terms of fine-tuning the active systems operation parameters in the building.

COMIS includes the development of the FastBuildingModeling Modelica library.

# [](#hamopy)hamopy

[Hamopy](http://srouchier.github.io/hamopy/) is a Python library for the numerical simulation of one-dimensional heat, air and moisture (HAM) transfer in porous materials

# [](#InverseBuilding)InverseBuilding

[InverseBuilding](http://srouchier.github.io/InverseBuilding/) is a series of tutorials showing how to solve various types of inverse problems, or model calibration problems, in Python. The physical application mostly revolves around heat transfer in building physics

# [](#Triflow)Triflow

[Triflow](https://locie.github.io/triflow/) is a Python library that provides an easy way to write transient dynamic systems with 1D finite difference discretisation, with fast temporal solvers.
